# Database of chemical functions for the CadQuery organic molecule modeling program

## Project Abstraction

CadQuery is an organic molecule modeling program that works as a script interpreter. The UA actor types in a script to represent an organic molecule, and CadQuery will model it accordingly. The script can be parameterized to make it a bit more polymorphic. Then a third party can fill in the details of the parameters.

## Project Relevance

Test driven development may be performed by sending an existing molecule model to the database and testing if it matches the expected molecule in function. If the description of the function matches what we expect then it works fine. If not, the function returned may offer a hint to workâ€™s wrong.

## Conceptual Design

Using composition, we can add in a database of organic molecules. The database contains organic molecules and their uses. If the molecule entered by the user resembles existing molecules, then the new contribution will attempt to guess at the function of the new molecule and suggest it to the UA actor. If the guess is wrong, it offers the UA actor an opportunity to describe the function of the new molecule both to describe it and to provide a possible new description to future similar molecules.

## Background

https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery/blob/master/README.md

### Building (from the cadquery README)

```
# Set up a new environment
conda create -n cadquery

# Activate the new environment
conda activate cadquery

# CadQuery development is moving quickly, so it is best to install the latest version from GitHub master
conda install -c conda-forge -c cadquery cadquery=master
```
